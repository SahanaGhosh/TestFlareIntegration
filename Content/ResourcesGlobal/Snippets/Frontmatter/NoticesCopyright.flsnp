        <p class="head2">U.S. Government Rights</p>
        <p>The Software is "commercial computer software," as defined by Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") 2.101. Pursuant to FAR 12.212 and 27.405-3 and Department of Defense FAR Supplement ("DFARS") 227.7202, the U.S. government acquires commercial computer software under the same terms by which the software is customarily provided to the public. Accordingly, Keysight provides the Software to U.S. government customers under its standard commercial license, which is embodied in its End User License Agreement (EULA), a copy of which can be found at <a href="http://www.keysight.com/find/sweula" target="_blank" class="KeysightRed">http://www.keysight.com/find/sweula</a> or <a href="https://support.ixiacom.com/support-services/warranty-license-agreements" target="_blank" class="KeysightRed">https://support.ixiacom.com/support-services/warranty-license-agreements</a>. The license set forth in the EULA represents the exclusive authority by which the U.S. government may use, modify, distribute, or disclose the Software. The EULA and the license set forth therein, does not require or permit, among other things, that Keysight: (1) Furnish technical information related to commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation that is not customarily provided to the public; or (2) Relinquish to, or otherwise provide, the government rights in excess of these rights customarily provided to the public to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation. No additional government requirements beyond those set forth in the EULA shall apply, except to the extent that those terms, rights, or licenses are explicitly required from all providers of commercial computer software pursuant to the FAR and the DFARS and are set forth specifically in writing elsewhere in the EULA. Key-sight shall be under no obligation to update, revise or otherwise modify the Software. With respect to any technical data as defined by FAR 2.101, pursuant to FAR 12.211 and 27.404.2 and DFARS 227.7102, the U.S. government acquires no greater than Limited Rights as defined in FAR 27.401 or DFAR 227.7103-5 (c), as applicable in any technical data. 52.227-14 (June 1987) or DFAR 252.227-7015 (b)(2) (November 1995), as applicable in any technical data.</p>
